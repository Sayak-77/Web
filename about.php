<h2>PROGRAMMING LANGAUGES:</h2>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output.Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.<br>
Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.<br>

<h2>DEVELOPERSHUB.io PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING RESOURCES:</h2>
<div  class="jishbox">
<h3>1.Resources for learning JAVA:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support 
Java without the need for recompilation.<br>
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.<br>

<h3>3.Resources for learning HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">Click here for more info</a></i></p>
<h4>ADVANTAGES OF HTML:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>EASY TO LEARN AND USE:
    <ul>
	<li>HTML is very easy to learn and understand. HTML is the first and foremost language that the person will go through for the one who is learning web development. It has simple tags, and there is no hectic of case sensitivity in HTML. 
	It simply has some tags that serve a specific purpose, and that’s it.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>HTML IS SUPPORTED BY ALL BROWSERS:
    <ul>
	<li> HTML supports almost all browsers around the globe. So there is no need to worry about the website written in HTML for the browser support as the website would easily show up in all the browsers if the program keeps in mind to optimize the website for the different browsers. 
	HTML provides an easy way to optimize the website in HTML according to browsers to the web developers.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>HTML IS BASIC FOR ALL PROGRAMMING LANGAUGES:
    <ul>
	<li>For the programmer to be either a frontend or backend developer, one must have knowledge of HTML as it is the basic language and all the other languages integrate with it while coding like JavaScript, JSP, Php, etc. Similarly, XML syntax is just like HTML and XML, which is used these days widely for data storage. 
	If one has good knowledge of HTML, it is easy working with XML too for him.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="jishgeneral"><b>For a brief introduction to HTML refer to the following video:</b></p>

<h3>4.Resources for learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br> 
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to 
improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">Click here for more info</a></i><p>
<h4>ADVANTAGES OF CSS:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>CSS SAVES TIME:
    <ul>
	<li>You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>EASY MAINTAINANCE:
    <ul>
	<li> To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>GLOBAL WEB STANDARDS:
    <ul>
	<li>Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="jishgeneral"><b>For a brief introduction to CSS refer to the following video:</b></p>

<h3>5.Resources for learning JavaScript:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.<br>
It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br>
Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>

<h4>ADVANTAGES OF JAVASCRIPT:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>SPEED:
    <ul>
	<li>Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser. 
	Unless outside resources are required, JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a backend server.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>SIMPLICITY:
    <ul>
	<li>JavaScript is relatively easy to understand, learn and implement</li>
	</ul>

<h3>6.Resources for learning about GitHub:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features.<br>
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.<br>
GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial. Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects.<br>
As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free.Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, but restricts private repositories 
to 2,000 minutes of GitHub Actions per month.<br>

<h4>ADVANTAGES OF GITHUB:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>MAKES IT EASY TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPENSOURCE PROJECTS:
    <ul>
	<li>Nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage their project. Using GitHub is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project. 
	If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using GitHub web interface.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>DOCUMENTATION:
    <ul>
	<li>By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to git that you can think of.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>TRACK CHANGES IN YOUR CODE ACROSS VERSIONS:
    <ul>
	<li>When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. 
	Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 >7.Resources for learning Flutter:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.<br>
The first version of Flutter was known as "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dart developer summit with the stated intent of being able to render consistently at 120 frames per second.<br>
During the keynote of Google Developer Days in Shanghai, Google announced Flutter Release Preview 2, which is the last big release before Flutter 1.0. On December 4, 2018, Flutter 1.0 was released at the Flutter Live event, denoting the 
first "stable" version of the Framework. On December 11, 2019, Flutter 1.12 was released at the Flutter Interactive event.On May 6, 2020, the Dart software development kit (SDK) in version 2.8 and the Flutter in version 1.17.0 were released, 
where support was added to the Metal API, improving performance on iOS devices (approximately 50%), new Material widgets, and new network tracking.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)" target="_blank">Click here for more info</a></i></p>
<h4>ADVANTAGES OF FLUTTER:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>SAME UI AND BUSINESS LOGIC IN ALL PLATFORMS:
    <ul>
	<li>Flutter doesn’t need any platform-specific UI components to render it’s UI. The only thing Flutter needs to show the application UI is a canvas to draw onto.
	The Flutter’s way of rendering makes the framework really stand out from the crowd eliminating any worries about the UI consistency on different platforms.In brief, sharing the UI and business logic, which is possible with Flutter, 
	saves time, effort and the health of the developer while not affecting the performance of the end product.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>REDUCES CODE DEVELOPMENT TIME:
    <ul>
	<li>Flutter’s “hot reload” feature, in turn, allows seeing the applied changes almost instantly, without even losing the current application state. And this is exactly what makes Flutter app development several times faster due to 
	the increased development speed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>SIMPLE PLATFORM-SPECIFIC LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION:
    <ul>
	<li>Flutter provides an easy to use way of establishing the communication between platform-native code and Dart through platform channels. This way, you can implement anything that a native app can do on a Flutter app, with just a 
	little extra effort on the native side.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.Resources for learning Kotlin:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.<br>
On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers.Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler.
The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target Java 8 up to 16, for optimization, or allows for more features, e.g. Java 8 related with Kotlin 1.4, and has experimental record class support for Java 16 compatibility.Kotlin support 
for JavaScript (i.e. classic back-end) is considered stable in Kotlin 1.3 by its developers, while Kotlin/JS (IR-based) in version 1.4, is considered alpha. Kotlin/Native Runtime (for e.g. Apple support) is considered beta.<br>

<h4>ADVANTAGES OF KOTLIN:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>KOTLIN ALLOWS WRITING LESS CODE:
    <ul>
	<li>Less code is important but there is readability that also should be considered and desirably improved. With Kotlin, you receive them both. JetBrains did their best to make the language as concise as possible, and they managed to do it.
    Less code, when done right, results in fewer bugs. When you let the framework take care of certain mundane aspects of coding, you can focus on more important things. Kotlin is all about high readability, simplicity, and the facilitation of the app development process.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>ADOPTING KOTLIN IS EASY:
    <ul>
	<li>If you want to facilitate the product maintenance or streamline custom Android app development, you can assign two or three engineers to move the project to Kotlin starting from a small part of the codebase.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>IT EMPOSES NO RUNTIME OVERHEAD:
    <ul>
	<li>The standard library is small and tight: it consists mostly of focused extensions to the Java standard library. Heavy use of compile-time inlining means functional constructs like pipelines of map/filter/reduce compile similarly to an imperative version of the same code.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.Resources for learning SQL:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>It is a language to communicate with a database, and is the standard language for handling data in relational database management system (RDBMS). A relational database management system, is a database management system in which the database is 
organized and accessed according to the relationships between data items and these relationships are expressed by means of Tables.<br> 
SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as updating data on a database, or retrieving data from the database. It is helpful in handling structured data which incorporates relations among entities and variables. It provides us with the advantage to access many 
records with a single command and also eliminating the need to specify how to specify a record. <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">Click here for more info</a></i></p>
<h4>ADVANTAGES OF SQL:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>FASTER QUERY PROCESSING:
    <ul>
	<li>Large amount of data is retrieved quickly and efficiently. Operations like Insertion, deletion, manipulation of data is also done in almost no time. </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>STANDARDIZED LANGAUGE:
    <ul>
	<li>Due to documentation and long establishment over years, it provides a uniform platform worldwide to all its users. </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>PORTABLE:
    <ul>
	<li>It can be used in programs in PCs, server, laptops independent of any platform (Operating System, etc). Also, it can be embedded with other applications as per need/requirement/use. </li>
	</ul>

<h3>10.Resources for learning Linux:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.Distributions include the Linux 
kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.<br>
Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.Because of the dominance of the Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux also has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.
 Although it is used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop computers, the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US K–12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US. Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux)<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Click here for more info</a></i></p>
<h4>ADVANTAGES OF LINUX:</h4>
<ul class="jishgeneral">
<li>SECURITY:
    <ul>
	<li>The Linux security feature is the main reason that it is the most favorable option for developers. It is not completely safe, but it is less vulnerable than others. Each application needs to authorize by the admin user. The virus is not executed until the administrator provides the access password. Linux systems do not require any antivirus program.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>STABILITY:
    <ul>
	<li>Linux is more stable than other operating systems. Linux does not require to reboot the system to maintain performance levels. It rarely hangs up or slow down. It has big up-times.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>FLEXIBILITY:
    <ul>
	<li>Linux operating system is very flexible. It can be used for desktop applications, embedded systems, and server applications too. It also provides various restriction options for specific computers. We can install only necessary components for a system.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>11.Resources for learning Cloud Computing:</h3>
<p class="jishgeneral"><i>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available 
to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server. Clouds may be limited to a single organization 
(enterprise clouds), or be available to multiple organizations (public cloud).Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front 
IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable 
demand,providing the burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.<br>
